🔍 Restating the Problem

Randomization: Done at member level, not prescriber level.

Reality: Prescribers treat multiple members (both target and control), so the treatment “spills over.”

Outcome: Mixed or counterintuitive results at member level, because members share the same prescriber environment.

KPI: EDS (eligible days supply) conversion within 150 days of outreach.

🎯 The Core Issue

Your randomization unit (member) ≠ your exposure unit (prescriber).
→ Interference / Spillover across members within prescribers.

If even a small fraction of a prescriber’s patients were targeted, that prescriber may change behavior for all their patients — biasing your estimated treatment effect toward zero or even reversing signs depending on exposure mix.

🔬 Frameworks to Fix / Reinterpret Results
1. Reframe the Analysis to a “Cluster Exposure” Framework

Treat prescribers as clusters, and model degree of exposure rather than binary treatment.

Variables:

prescriber_target_share: % of that prescriber’s patients who were targeted.

is_target: whether this specific member was targeted.

control covariates: new member, adherence history, etc.

You can then run:

 is a random effect at prescriber level (mixed model).

➡️ Interpretation:

β₁ → direct member-level effect of being targeted

β₂ → spillover effect from prescriber exposure

β₃ → whether direct impact changes with prescriber exposure

📍Use: statsmodels.MixedLM in Python or lme4::lmer() in R.

2. Aggregate to Prescriber Level

If you suspect strong spillover, aggregate members’ outcomes to the prescriber level:

ConversionRate

+controls+ϵ

	​


Then analyze how conversion rates move with prescriber exposure levels.

➡️ You can bucket prescribers into quartiles by exposure and visualize trends.

This avoids contamination across members within a prescriber.
