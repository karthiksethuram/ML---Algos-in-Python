🧮 Step 1. Coefficient summary (from your GEE)
Variable	Coefficient	p-value	Interpretation
Intercept	1.30	0.00	Baseline log-odds of conversion for a control member with average prescriber share and not new.
is_target_member	+0.22	0.00	Direct effect of being targeted (vs control), when prescriber’s target share = 0.
presc_target_share	+0.156	0.034	Spillover effect: control members convert more when their prescriber has more targeted patients.
is_target_member × presc_target_share	–0.375	0.00	Interaction: effect of being targeted shrinks (or even reverses) as prescriber’s exposure increases.
is_new_member	+0.298	0.00	New members are more likely to convert overall.
🔍 Step 2. Expressed in human terms

Let’s define:

𝑇
𝑖
=
1
T
i
	​

=1 if member is targeted.

𝑆
𝑗
S
j
	​

 = prescriber’s target share (between 0–1).

𝑌
=
Y= log-odds(EDS conversion).

Then your model implies:

logit
(
𝑃
(
convert
)
)
=
1.30
+
0.22
𝑇
+
0.156
𝑆
−
0.375
(
𝑇
×
𝑆
)
+
0.298
(
new member
)
logit(P(convert))=1.30+0.22T+0.156S−0.375(T×S)+0.298(new member)
✅ For a control member (T = 0)
logit
(
𝑃
)
=
1.30
+
0.156
𝑆
+
0.298
(
new
)
logit(P)=1.30+0.156S+0.298(new)

→ Control members benefit modestly when prescriber has more targeted patients — this is the spillover effect (prescribers change behavior even for control patients).

✅ For a targeted member (T = 1)
logit
(
𝑃
)
=
1.30
+
(
0.22
)
+
(
0.156
−
0.375
)
𝑆
+
0.298
(
new
)
logit(P)=1.30+(0.22)+(0.156−0.375)S+0.298(new)
logit
(
𝑃
)
=
1.52
−
0.219
𝑆
+
0.298
(
new
)
logit(P)=1.52−0.219S+0.298(new)

So as 
𝑆
S (prescriber exposure) increases, the incremental benefit of targeting that member declines.

🧠 Step 3. Why does the negative interaction make sense (statistically and behaviorally)?

This is one of the most common findings in partial interference experiments — and it’s actually interpretable if you think of diminishing marginal returns.

Possible real-world explanations:

Prescriber-level saturation / ceiling effect
When many of a prescriber’s patients are targeted, that prescriber has already changed behavior — so targeting another member under that prescriber yields less additional lift.
→ The marginal impact of “member being targeted” goes down as prescriber’s exposure increases.

Indirect spillover already covers most of the benefit
High prescriber exposure → control members get improved outcomes (the +0.156).
That means the “gap” between targeted vs control members narrows, producing a negative interaction.

Campaign overlap
Prescribers with high target shares might receive many EHR alerts or messages — after a certain saturation, alerts may be ignored, reducing incremental impact.

Statistical perspective
Interaction term captures how the slope of is_target_member changes with prescriber_share.
If prescriber_share and is_target_member are correlated (common, because many members share same prescriber), the negative sign may partly reflect this collinearity — essentially the model “shares credit” between the spillover and direct effects.

📈 Step 4. Quantify with example probabilities

Let’s estimate approximate predicted probabilities (assuming is_new_member = 0, for clarity):

presc_target_share	Control (T=0)	Targeted (T=1)	Lift (Δ)
0.0	logit⁻¹(1.30) = 0.79	logit⁻¹(1.52) = 0.82	+3%
0.5	logit⁻¹(1.30+0.156×0.5)=0.81	logit⁻¹(1.52-0.219×0.5)=0.81	0%
1.0	logit⁻¹(1.30+0.156)=0.81	logit⁻¹(1.52-0.219)=0.80	-1%

➡️ So when prescriber exposure is low (few of their patients targeted), targeting helps (+3%).
When prescriber exposure is high, everyone benefits a bit (spillover), but direct targeting adds no extra effect — consistent with saturation.
